    "_Latent Dirichlet Allocation_ is a [generative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) model for topic modeling. Given a collection of documents, an LDA inference algorithm attempts to determined (in an unsupervised manner) the topics discussed in the documents. It makes the assumption that each document is generated by a probability model, and, when doing inference, we try to find the parameters that best fit the model (as well as unseen/latent variables generated by the model). If you are unfamiliar with LDA, Edwin Chen has a [friendly introduction](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/) you should read.\n",
